I primarily use qualitative and design methods to inform real-world technical design and tech policy. I develop new methods for participatory AI, using visuals and storyelling to meaningfully enage people with low literacy and limited formal education. During my PhD, I conducted empirical studies in rural villages in Togo, rural ranching communities in the United States, among tech workers at large engineering organizations, and users on Twitter. <p> I received my B.A. summa cum laude in Sociology from NYU. Advised by <a href='https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/deirdre-royster.html'>Deirdre Royster</a> and <a href='https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/ruth-horowitz.html'>Ruth Horowitz</a>, my <a href='https://cas.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/cas/documents/Inquiry_XVIII.pdf'>undergrad thesis</a> explored racial inequalities in the US criminal legal system. <p> Beyond academia, I worked at an acquired <a href='https://www.procore.com/press/procore-to-acquire-honest-buildings-to-enhance-project-management-for-owners'> tech startup</a>, <a href='https://www.rekhiwolk.com/'>civil rights law firm</a>, and spent four summers interning at <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/'> Microsoft</a> where I helped develop a <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/responsible-ai-maturity-model/'> responsible AI maturity model</a>, tooling to support red teaming, and worked on Microosft Copilot. </p> <p><font color='#B7950B'>&#9733; I am on the academic job market (for tenure track positions and postdocs) in 2024-2025!</font></p>",
