I use established qualitative methods (e.g., interviews, participant observation) and develop new methods as needed (e.g., sociotechnical visuals, storytelling).<p>Funded by organizations such as the  <a href='https://www.ssrc.org/'>Social Science Research Council</a> and the <a href='https://cega.berkeley.edu/'>Center for Effective Global Action</a>, I have engaged tech workers, homeless outreach workers, and people living in rural Togo, Malawi, Rwanda, South Africa, and America on topics ranging from  <a href='https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3757514'>responsible AI</a> (CSCW '25), <a href='https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3710968'>data privacy in humanitarian aid</a> (CSCW '25), <a https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3443705'>rural internet access</a> (TOCHI '21), and <a href='https://www.givedirectly.org/explain_ai/'>AI explainability</a> (Blog). <p>I hold a PhD from the <a href='https://ischool.berkeley.edu/'> UC Berkeley School of Information</a>, and a B.A. from <a href='https://www.nyu.edu/'> New York University</a> in Sociology (summa cum laude). At UC Berkeley, I was co-advised by <a href='https://jennaburrell.org/'>Dr. Jenna Burrell</a> and <a https://www.jblumenstock.com/'>Dr. Joshua Blumenstock</a>, and was an  <a href='https://cltc.berkeley.edu/program/ai-policy-hub/'>AI Policy Fellow</a> affiliated with the <a href='https://afog.berkeley.edu/'>Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Group</a> and the <a href='https://gol.berkeley.edu/'>Global Opportunities Lab</a>. At NYU, I was advised by <a href='https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/deirdre-royster.html'>Dr. Deirdre Royster</a> and <a href='https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/ruth-horowitz.html'>Dr. Ruth Horowitz</a> where my <a href='https://cas.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/cas/documents/Inquiry_XVIII.pdf'>undergraduate sociology thesis</a> explored racial inequalities in the US criminal legal system. <p>Beyond academia, I worked at an acquired <a href='https://www.procore.com/press/procore-to-acquire-honest-buildings-to-enhance-project-management-for-owners'> tech startup</a>, <a href='https://www.rekhiwolk.com/'>civil rights law firm</a>, and spent four summers interning at <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/'> Microsoft</a> where I helped develop a <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/responsible-ai-maturity-model/'> responsible AI maturity model</a>, tooling to support AI red teaming, and worked on Microsoft Copilot. </p>",
